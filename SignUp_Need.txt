Define Database Structure


DB table   -----   Model Name
admin   ---------   admin   (if db table and model not use the singular and puler like emp --- emp then in this we need to do some mannual config)

--> php artisan migrate

--> to rollback 
-->php artisan migrate:rollback (To goto the previous state)
--> php artisan migrate:refresh (For creating syn or refresing)  --> first delete all the tables then again it will create

php artisan make:migration add_columns_to_tableName_table (like => add_columns_to_admin_table)
